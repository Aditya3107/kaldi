/**
   This class is for speaker-dependent feature-space transformations --
   principally various varieties of fMLLR, including mean-only, diagonal and
   block-diagonal versions -- which are intended for placement in the bottleneck
   of a neural net.  So code-wise, we'd have: bottom neural net, then transform,
   then top neural net.  The transform is designed to be differentiable, i.e. it
   can be used during training to propagate derivatives from the top neural net
   down to the bottom neural net.  The reason this is non-trivial (i.e. why it's
   not just a matrix multiplication) is that the value of the transform itself
   depends on the features, and also on the speaker-independent statistics for
   each class (i.e. the mean and variance), which also depend on the features
   sicne we estimate them from the same minibatch.
   You can view this as an extension of things like BatchNorm, except the
   interface is more complicated because there is a dependence on the per-frame
   class labels.

   The class labels we'll use here will probably be derived from some kind of
   minimal tree, with hundreds instead of thousands of states.  Part of the
   reason for using a smaller number of states is that, to make the thing
   properly differentiable during training, we need to use a small enough number
   of states that we can obtain a reasonable estimate for the mean and (spherical)
   variance of a Gaussian for each one in training time.   Anyway, as you can see in
   http://isl.anthropomatik.kit.edu/pdf/Nguyen2017.pdf, it's generally better
   for this kind of thing to use "simple target models" for adaptation rather than
   very complex models.

   Note: for training utterances we'll generally get the class labels used for
   adatpation in a supervised manner, either by aligning a previous system like
   a GMM system, or-- more likely-- from the (soft) posteriors of the the
   numerator graphs.  In test time, we'll usually be getting these class labels
   from some kind of unsupervised process.

   Because we tend to train neural nets on fairly small fixed-size chunks
   (e.g. 1.5 seconds), and transforms like fMLLR don't tend to work very well
   until you have about 5 seconds of data, we will usually be arranging those
   chunks into groups where all members of the group come from the same
   speaker.  So, for instance, instead of 128 totally separate chunks, we might
   have 4 chunks per speaker and 32 speakers.

   The basic pattern of usage of class DifferentiableTransform is this:

     - Initialize the object prior to training, e.g. with InitFromConfig().

     - Use this object to jointly train the 'bottom' (feature-extracting) and
       'top' (ASR) network.  This involves functions TrainingForward() and
       TrainingBackward() of this object; the posteriors used for that might be
       dumped with the 'egs' (e.g. come from a GMM system), or might be derived
       from the alignment of the numerator lattices in chain training.  Any
       class means that must be estimated, would be estimated on each minibatch
       (we'll try to keep the minibatches as large as possible, and may use
       tricks like using bigger minibatch sizes for the bottom
       (feature-extracting) network and smaller ones for the top one, to save
       memory.  At this stage, this object will most likely only contain
       configuration information and not any kind of data-dependent statistics.

     - Use some reasonable-sized subset of training data to accumulate more
       reliable statistics for the target model using Accumulate() followed
       by Estimate().  If NumFinalIterations() is more than one you may need
       do this in a short loop.

     - In test time, for each speaker you'll:
       - call GetEmptySpeakerStats() to get an object to store adaptation statistics
         for your speaker.
       - Obtain some class-level posteriors somehow (could come from an initial
         decoding pass on all the data, or from the final decoding pass on the
         part of the data you've seen up till now).  Use these to call
         TestingAccumulate() to accumulate speaker stats.
       - Call TestingForward() with the speaker-stats object to get
         adapted features.

     This is the function you call in training time, for the forward
     pass; it adapts the features.  By "training time" here, we
     assume you are training the 'bottom' neural net, that produces
     the features in 'input'; if you were not training it, it would
     be the same as test time as far as this function is concerned.

     @param [in] input  The original, un-adapted features; these
              will typically be output by a neural net, the 'bottom' net in our
              terminology.  This will correspond to a whole minibatch,
              consisting of multiple speakers and multiple sequences (chunks)
              per speaker.  Caution: in the input and
              output features, and the posteriors, the 't' has the larger
              stride than the minibatch-index 'n', so the order is:
              first frame of all sequences; then the second frame of
              all sequences; and so on.  This is the default order in
              nnet3; see operator < of nnet3::Index.
     @param [in] num_chunks   The number of individual sequences
              (e.g., chunks of speech) represented in 'input'.
              input.NumRows() will equal num_sequences times the number
              of time frames.
     @param [in] num_spk  The number of speakers.  Must be greater than one, and
             must divide num_chunks.  The number of chunks per speaker
             must be the same for all speakers (it will equal num_chunks / num_spk),
             and the chunks for a speaker must be consecutively numbered.
     @param [in] posteriors  (note: this is a vector of vector of
             pair<int32,BaseFloat>).  This provides, in 'soft-count'
             form, the class supervision information that is used for the
             adaptation.  posteriors.size() will be equal to input.NumRows(),
             and the ordering of its elements is the same as the ordering
             of the rows of input (i.e. the 't' has the larger stride).
             There is no assumption that the posteriors sum to one;
             this allows you to do things like silence weighting.  But
             the posteriors are expected to be nonnegative.
     @param [out] output  The adapted output.  This matrix should have the
             same dimensions as 'input'.  It does not have to be free of
             NaNs when you call this function.
     @return  This function returns either NULL or an object of type
             DifferentiableTransform*, which is expected to later be given
             to the function TrainingBackward().  It will store
             any information that needs to be remembered for the backward
             phase.

     This does the backpropagation, during the training pass.

                      call to TrainingForward() (may be NULL).  This function
                      takes ownership of the pointer.  If for some reason the
                      backward pass was not done, the caller will likely
                      want to delete it themselves.
     @param [in,out] input_deriv  The derivative at the input, i.e.
                      dF/d(input), where F is the function we are
                      evaluating.  Must have the same dimension as

                      be training (perhaps with less weight) on
                      the unadapted features, in order to prevent them
                      from deviating too far from the adapted ones
                      and to allow the same model to be used for the
